## Upcoming --
> Aaron
- [ ] We will be moving from a Mongoose DB model over to SQL. I would like you to familiarize yourself with the current schemas  (fleet-pay-export\api\src\models\****)  
and work to translate them into the SQL database that will be provided.

- [ ] While I am preparing the database and server, please do some research and discovery on what its going to take to translate these models. 

- [ ] Once that is complete, we will review the node.js backend to declare all the API routes to the database. 

> Jacque
- [ ] Work with Jake to develop users stories and timeline. This will include the GUI functionality in figma, MVP functionality, and checkpoints / goalposts to hit. 
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the development environment and common practices, since it looks like we are doing this on our own. 
- [ ] Create and organize Board with Jake. 

> Jake
- [ ] First work to provide development database with authentication and access to all parties involved,
- [ ] Then work with Jacque on previously stated tasks.
